## Overview 

Welcome to my Social Link Profile! This is a simple website created using HTML and CSS. It showcases a genral social media links and includes sections discussing the challenges faced, the process followed, what I learned, and plans for continued development.

### The challenge

The main challenge during the development of this social link profile was ensuring responsive design across different devices and browsers. I also faced some difficulties in styling the social media icons using CSS.

## My process

I started by designing the layout using HTML and then added styles using both inline and internal CSS. The box model and pseudo-classes were crucial in structuring and styling the elements. I iteratively refined the design until I achieved the desired look and functionality.


### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3 (including box model and pseudo-classes)


### What I learned

Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of CSS properties like box model and pseudo-classes. I also learned how to create a simple yet effective layout using HTML and CSS only. Below are few things that I learned whiele creating this website.

Psedo class - 

h3:hover{
      background-color: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
      color:hsl(0, 0%, 8%) ; 
      cursor: pointer;
    }



### Continued development

In the future, I plan to enhance the design by adding more interactive elements and improving responsiveness. I also aim to incorporate JavaScript for additional functionality, such as dynamic content loading.
